    <h2>Aboriginal Culture Before Colonisation</h2>
    <p>
      Aboriginal culture is one of the oldest living cultures in the world, with traditions passed down
      through generations for more than <strong>60,000 years</strong>.
      Before colonisation, Indigenous Australians maintained complex societies deeply connected to land,
      language, and spirituality.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Connection to Land</h2>
    <p>
      For Aboriginal Australians, land is not something to be owned, but something to be cared for.
      Every part of the landscape holds cultural meaning, stories, and responsibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Different groups were custodians of specific territories, managing land sustainably through knowledge
      developed over thousands of years.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Dreamtime Beliefs</h2>
    <p>
      Dreamtime (also called the Dreaming) refers to Aboriginal creation stories that explain the origins
      of the land, animals, people, and laws of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      These stories were shared through oral storytelling, song, dance, and art, helping preserve knowledge
      across generations.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Languages and Communication</h2>
    <p>
      Before European arrival, more than <strong>250 Aboriginal languages</strong> were spoken across Australia,
      with hundreds of dialects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Language played a vital role in maintaining identity, law, and connection to country.
      Many languages were closely tied to specific regions and landscapes.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Art, Music, and Storytelling</h2>
    <p>
      Aboriginal art includes rock paintings, carvings, body art, and ceremonial designs.
      These artworks often tell stories of ancestors, journeys, and important cultural laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      Music and instruments such as the didgeridoo were used in ceremonies and storytelling,
      strengthening cultural identity and community bonds.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Social Structure and Law</h2>
    <p>
      Aboriginal societies were organised through kinship systems that governed relationships,
      marriage, responsibilities, and social behaviour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Law was passed orally and reinforced through ceremony, ensuring harmony within communities
      and respect for the natural world.
