    <h2>Ancient Australia</h2>
    <p>
      Ancient Australia refers to the period long before European colonisation, when Indigenous Australians
      lived across the continent for more than <strong>60,000 years</strong>.
      This makes Aboriginal culture one of the oldest continuous human cultures in the world.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Arrival of the First Australians</h2>
    <p>
      Archaeological evidence suggests that the first humans arrived in Australia during the last Ice Age,
      when sea levels were lower and land bridges connected parts of Southeast Asia to the Australian continent.
    </p>
    <p>
      These early Australians travelled, adapted, and survived in a wide range of environments including
      deserts, coastlines, mountains, and tropical forests.

    <h2>Daily Life in Ancient Australia</h2>
    <p>
      Life in ancient Australia was based on deep knowledge of the land. Indigenous Australians hunted animals,
      fished rivers and oceans, and gathered plants, seeds, and fruits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tools were made from stone, wood, and bone, and shelters were built to suit local climates.
      Communities moved seasonally to follow food sources.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Land Management and Sustainability</h2>
    <p>
      Indigenous Australians practised sophisticated land management techniques.
      One of the most important methods was controlled burning, sometimes called “fire-stick farming.”
    </p>
    <p>
      This practice reduced the risk of large bushfires, encouraged plant growth,
      and created habitats for animals, showing a strong understanding of environmental balance.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Archaeological Evidence</h2>
    <p>
      Evidence of ancient life can be seen today in rock art, stone tools, burial sites,
      and ancient camps found across Australia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sites such as rock shelters and engraved landscapes provide insight into early beliefs,
      daily activities, and long-distance trade networks.
